              <p style="font-size: 18px;" class="card-text">The seat of this custom-made Pulsar NS200 scrambler is a single-piece unit, finished in the red shade and carrying a ribbed design for the front part. The modifiers have equipped the bike with a custom exhaust system with a raised muffler for better off-road potential and unique looks. The handlebar is clip-on type while the huge belly pan further adds protection to the lower engine components.

                Mechanically, no changes have been made and the bike is powered by the same 199.5cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine, producing 23.5 HP of maximum power and 18.3 Nm of peak torque. At present, the stock model of the Pulsar NS200 costs around INR 1.33 lakh for the BS6-compliant version.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 18px;" class="card-text">The Bajaj Pulsar NS200 Scrambler you see here has been custom-made by Tokwa Party Garage, based in the Philippines. The basic profile and engine section of the motorcycle hint that no changes have been made to the frame to avoid any complications related to the stability factor of the Pulsar NS200. The bike has been equipped with custom parts that match the paint scheme on the fuel tank. The metallic finish is purely visible on every part, looking amazing on the custom-made visor that feels directly derived from a litre-class cruiser motorcycle.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 18px;" class="card-text">Probably the only place we are a bit disappointed with the new Pulsar is in the accessories department. The highlight of the accessories department in the new Pulsar is the all new beautiful looking speedometer. The orange backlit LCD panel is easily readable even during the day but is not of the always on types. The console also gets a clock which is definitely handy. The 55/60 W H4 headlights work like a charm and provide good illumination. Weirdly though the park lights come on only if the engine is on. The indicators move from the flexible type on the older Pulsars to semi flexible ones with no auto cancellation. The blue backlit switch gear takes a bit getting used to as all the switches are placed a bit odd but the plastic quality is a bit cheap. The grab rails are very functional and strong. Mirrors on the P200NS are functional but are small and do not provide the full vision. The centre stand does not come standard, not that you would need it much but just in case you do, it needs to be bought separately. The front number plates face the heavens and are difficult to read. The biggest disappointment came in the form of the Pulsar logo on the tank and the reserve-main knob which are plastic and feel very cheap. The side stand sensor is placed very open and easy to tamper with. The saree guard thankfully is integrated aesthetically with the swing arm and does not look out of place.</p>

There are only few motorcycles in the country which comes with liquid cooling system and Pulsar 200NS will be the basic model to feature liquid-cooled engine in the country. Coming to the triple spark technology, it provides even better combustion compared to twin spark which results in higher fuel efficiency and better power output</p>
