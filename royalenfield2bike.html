              <p style="font-size: 18px;" class="card-text">A unique saree guard with square pattern has been used by EIMOR Customs on this typical Bullet 350. The stock model of the motorcycle is powered by a 346cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine producing 19.8 BHP at 5250 rpm and 28 Nm at 4000 rpm. The engine comes mated to a 5-speed gearbox. The Bullet series has been in production since 1932 and comes with nearly the same design  from Light face that time. This has helped Royal Enfield claim a huge dedicated fan following in India.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 18px;" class="card-text">The team has approached this stock Himalayan at all angles and has managed to radicalise the stock bike to its maximum Tank Design. Starting with its engine, this is bored out to displace 500cc with the help of a big bore kit. Also fitted are a high lift cam, a programmable ECU and a custom exhaust with a carbon fiber tip. That is not the only place where Arjun Raina has used carbon fiber. All of its body panels including its knuckle guards, fuel tank and a custom fairing is made of carbon fiber which is cured in-house by MotoExotica. Himalayan’s stock rear subframe is replaced too. All of it combined will definitely have contributed to a lot of weight savings.</p>

              <p style="font-size: 18px;" class="card-text">This RE TBTS 500, nay, the Blue Raider 540 isn’t the first-ever mod-job by Bulleteer Customs, but it’s certainly among the best modifications on an RE that we have seen so far. The modified motorcycle you see here comes draped in a shade of metallic blue. From the looks of it, the front fender comes from the Classic series. The LED headlamp and the single-pod instrument console are of course aftermarket units. Among the highlights of the modifications at the front are the handlebar-end turn indicators. The wide and the rather high-set handlebar gets chrome-plated rear view mirrors to enhance the loudness of the design.</p>
